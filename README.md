# CORS 2021 Deep Learning hands-on tutorial

This tutorial in meant to be run using [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

Note: you can install [pytorch+matplotlib+jupyter](https://timoast.github.io/blog/installing-pytorch/) to run the notebooks locally if you prefer, however this is at your own risks as we will not be able to provide any support for the installation during the tutorial.

# From scratch

The first 30 minutes of the session will be dedicated to building and training a small neural network from scratch in PyTorch.

To start please open Google colab, follow the next steps:
1. Choose File -> Import Notebook and copy-paste the following URL and press the search button
https://github.com/gasse/cors_2021_tutorial/blob/main/from_scratch.ipynb
2. Select File -> Save a copy to Drive
3. Activate GPU execution by choosing Runtime -> Change runtime type -> GPU

# MNIST

For the second half of the session, we will train a state-of-the-art neural network in PyTorch, to tackle the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html) digit recogition task.

To start please open Google colab, follow the next steps:
1. Choose File -> Import Notebook and copy-paste the following URL and press the search button
https://github.com/gasse/cors_2021_tutorial/blob/main/mnist.ipynb
2. Select File -> Save a copy to Drive
3. Activate GPU execution by choosing Runtime -> Change runtime type -> GPU
